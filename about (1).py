    st.write('''Combining Monument Recognition with Augmented Reality (AR) marks an exciting yet complex venture in image classification. This project represents the nexus of modern technology, bringing together Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and AR to innovate the way we connect with our historical heritage. We are crafting an Android app designed to merge the precision of deep learning with the vividness of AR, offering a rich, interactive tour of historical sites.
Central to our project is the use of CNNs for the swift identification of monuments. By instructing these networks with a diverse array of monument imagery, we aim to build a strong model that excels in real-time detection and classification. This model becomes the backbone of our Android application, enabling users to direct their camera at a monument and receive immediate recognition along with detailed historical insights.
Enhancing this identification feature is AR technology, which converts simple sightseeing into an engaging educational experience. Through the device's lens, users are immersed in a virtual historical account, complete with contextual narratives and multimedia presentations that make history come alive. This blend of CNNs and AR doesn't just improve the way we visit historical landmarks; it democratizes the appreciation of cultural heritage, making it more interactive and accessible to a wider audience''')
